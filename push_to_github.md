# GitHub Repository Setup Commands

## ✅ COMPLETED STEPS:
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Files committed locally
- ✅ Remote origin added: https://github.com/PK-SANGAMESWAR/pneumonia-detection-deep-learning.git
- ✅ Branch renamed to 'main'

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
Go to: https://github.com/new

**Repository Details:**
- **Name**: `pneumonia-detection-deep-learning`
- **Description**: `Deep Learning project for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays using CNN, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 (CheXNet). Best model achieves 85%+ accuracy.`
- **Visibility**: Public (recommended) or Private
- **❌ DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

### 2. Push to GitHub
After creating the repository, run:
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

## If you need to authenticate:
- Use your GitHub username
- For password, use a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)
- To create a token: GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
